Automatically alert your developer when you install/update/remove a plugin.

== Description ==

You (the project manager or WP admin) are constantly needing to tell your developer that you added/updated/removed a plugin
on the live site so he can keep his dev environment semi-synced. This eliminates that need, by just shooting them an email
with the plugin information and what happened.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-install-notification.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
